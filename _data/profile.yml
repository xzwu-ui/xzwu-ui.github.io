    Hi there👋 I'm Demi Ruohan Wang, a Master's student at <a href="https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University, Language Technologies Institute</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a short term, I'm focused on conducting research on <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>, as well as learning to be a <strong>full-stack independent developer</strong>. In the long run, I hope to build a startup and contribute to the development of <strong>AGI</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've gained research experience through internships at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research Asia</a>, <a href="https://www.bytedance.com/en/" target="_blank">ByteDance</a> and <a href="https://x.com/osunlp" target="_blank">OSU NLP Group</a> (supervised by <a href="https://ysu1989.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yu Su</a>). 
    I'm currently interested in <strong>building agents</strong> that can <strong>better understand and execute tasks</strong>, and enhancing <strong>model's multimodal reasoning abilities</strong> to support this.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am seeking Summer 2026 internships as a Machine Learning Engineer or Research Scientist. Feel free to reach out if you have relevant opportunities!
  </p>
